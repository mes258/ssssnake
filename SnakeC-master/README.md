# SnakeC
The classic game of Snake in a terminal, written in C with ncurses.
![](screenshots/gameplay-snake.gif)

This game is in series of game in which I try to reimplement classical games in
the terminal using nothing but straight C and ncurses.

# How to build
Simply run in the same folder:
```shell
make
```

# How to run
On UNIX-like operating systems use;
```shell
./snake
```

It can also be placed within your `$PATH` and run with simply `pong` from any folder.

Have not tried this on Windows, yet.
